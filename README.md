# Woodys-Machine

For the version published on the Game Jam webside, you need to create the folder "saves" in order to enable you to save.

There is a basic map editor included in this game.
For this, enter the save name, and add "#sudo" at the end of the save name when entry save name.
With this, you only have to use :
  B to change biome,
  maintain left clic to pre-place object,
  mouse-roll clic to change selected object,
  right clic to abort placement, and
  release left clic to place the object.

  WSQD in QWERTY, ZSQD in AZERTY, and arrows : move player
  Space : Launch a wrench
  E : put collected pieces in vessel
  Q or A : drop one piece (because wearing piece make you slower)
